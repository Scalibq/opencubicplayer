OpenCP 2.6.0pre6
  - and now the DirectX driver works :-)

OpenCP 2.6.0pre5
  - fixed DirectX driver for DirectX7 or later

OpenCP 2.6.0pre4
  - For all newskool-, non-SB-, non-GUS, non-EWS-, non-WSS-people out there
    using Win9x:
      finally, you can use *every* soundcard supported by windows if you
      start the CP in a dos-box, using the devpVXD.
      (it's like the VSOUND-driver for the IT)
    devpVXD bringing you the following advantages:
    + no more incompatible soundcard. almost every soundcard should work,
      assuming that there exists a direct-sound-driver.
    + no more soundcard-blocking. you can play other (DirectSound-)sources,
      they will be mixed (by windows or by your soundcard, if it's capable
      of doing this.)
    + a bit better background playing, even in "fullscreen"-background
    keep in mind that devpVXD is a DEVP, not a DEVW.
    read the FAQ for more information.
  - completely new mixer device, making massive use of the CPU's Floating
    Point Unit and bringing you the following advantages:
    + 16777216x linear or 256x cubic spline oversampling (or none)
    + a theoretical 3000dB of Signal/Noise ratio (can your sound card
      handle this?)
    + sample-exact volume ramping (optional)
    + special anti-click mechanism which does NOT soften up the samples
      (also optional if you REALLY want your .ITs being messed up like
       in the tracker)
    + native postprocessor plug-in interface for maximum quality plug-ins
    + about THREE times faster than the Quality Mixer on Pentium and
      above machines (and far better sound quality)
    Of course, there are also some disadvantages:
    - on 386/486 and equivalent machines (K5, Cx6x86) better forget realtime
      performance, but you can still use it for diskwriting
    - the mixer sucks a lot of memory (stores all samples in 32bit
      format), so be prepared for having about four times the free mem the
      size of the tune you want to play is
  - configurable software reverb/chorus plugin for the FPU mixer...
    consider this the replacement for the good ole Echo Editor ;)
    (use ctrl-f5/f6 to control the reverb and ctrl-f7/f8 to control the
     chorus)
  - software reverb (not as configurable, tho) for the normal and
    Qualiy mixers
  - updated arcUMX.
  - MDZ-scan in archives (.ZIP right now) is back.
  - upgraded to new ampg. (and new binfile, but that's unimportant for the
    masses).
    should solve some problems regarding skipping.
  - WMA support. not yet fully working (not really seek, not all ASFs.)
  - new compiler switch /dRASTER enables raster lines showing the cpu
    usage of the mixing routines
  - Vesa 2.0 LFB support, try it or disable it (section [screen], uselfb=NO)
    (spectrum analyser now ~50% faster...)
  - more debug-output on crash (this is no improvement for cubic player
    *never* crashes!)
  - if called with a file as command line parameter, the player will
    now exit as soon playing ended (assumed looping is off)
  - number keys enable/disable channels again instead of soloing them
  - IT:  * instrument names are now shown correctly (thanks to Phoenix
           for telling me why)
  - XM:  * another nasty player bug fixed which you would never find anyway,
           it's just TOO special ;)
         * note retrig/multi retrig fixed


OpenCP 2.5.1
  - included new hypertext help system by Fabian Giesen (Ryg/Chrome Design)
  - MID: everything's much easier now. The original Gravis ULTRASND.INI
         is included in the program and all non-GUS-owners can now simply
         make a MIDI subdir in opencp's dir and copy the patches into it.
         (This should solve a LOT of problems for you people out there)
  - MOD: * samples of some modules won't get messed up anymore
  - XM:  * the samples of modules saved with ModSuck, ehrm, ModPlug Tracker
           will now hopefully have correct loops (MP doesnt save
           'em correctly)
         * Speaking of ModPlug, XMs will now be played with up to 256 chans
         * also, several severe replay bugs fixed which were errationally
           introduced in 2.5.0 (oops ;)
         * Envelope handling fixed (a BIG thank to Psychad for this)
  - IT:  * now plays modules having a "+++" in the first order(s)
         * note retrig fixed
         * vibratos hopefully fixed
         * implemented carry envelopes (new in IT2.14 patch 4)
         * underground feature added by removing overground feature
  - MP3: * now recognizes/plays MP3s starting with the ID3 tag or other data
           (if it still doesn't (because of too long trader messys at the
            beginning of the file) simply try forcing the file type to MPx)
         * Cubic (!! ;) Spline interpolation when pitch is changed (enjoy)
  - WAV: * also implemented Cubic Spline interpolation (16bit waves only)
  - Interface: * doesn't crash/show garbage anymore when switching back
                 from WÅrfel Mode
               * new, faster analyser FFT code by Doj/Cubic
               * new background picture loader (by Doj):
                 -> GIF background pictures are supported
                 -> pictures will now change randomly when modes
                    are switched
               * new feature:
                 -> volume control ('m'), works only with sb atm,
                    for songmessage type 'M' (in uppercase ;)
  - devwiw: * removed Step C panning again, the old code really seemed
              to work better (i need DOCS on this!)
            * completely rewritten memory handling, it was pure luck if
              the old one worked at all.
  - devpdisk/devpmpx: MP3 to WAV and various other things should now work
                      (a bloody hack, but who does care)
  - Again a slight speed increase of quality mixer
  - general stability improved again
  - many memory leaks found and eliminated
  - removed CPLAUNCH.EXE again, making the archive somewhat bigger and
    loading somewhat slower, but the whole thing is a LOT more stable now
  - various minor but important fixes/modifications in some dlls
  - source: * improved makefile, doesnt link the default libs into the dlls
              anymore
            * now compiles correctly under Watcom 10.6
            * pre-alpha Win32 version for experimental purposes



OpenCP 2.5.0
  - FIRST real public final release thingy
  - nice HTML documentation by Doj/Cubic now available
  - major raise in the version number... hey, when EMagic can do this
    with Logic Audio, why shouldn't I? ;)
  - InterWave: * added correct panning for InterWave Step C or higher
               * fixed timing a bit
               * effects can now be turned off ;)
  - fileselector: choosing devices and soundcard inputs now works again ...
                  ... files submitted via the command line automatically
                  get played now again ...
                  ... and also, console output is no more written onto
                  the interface screen
                  (honestly, was I DRUNK when implementing that playlist
                   shit? ;)
  - included new ESS688 player device by Oleg Prokhorov (thanks!)
  - added "palette" setting to IW.INI to let you design your own ugly
    color scheme (tho, this is just a simple remapping, you can't change
    every single color)
  - bpm display is now finally DECIMAL :)
  - XM: notes with instrument number set some rows before will now
        play correctly
  - Mixer: nasty volume calculation bug causing hard-left panned samples
           to be phase-inverted removed (char? short? long? oh come on,
           what's the fuckin' difference? :)
  - IT: Pattern loader fixed (did crash/suck on some ITs)



OpenCP 2.0q_pre
  - fileselector: maybe there are no more LFN lookup bugs when using
                  DOS 6.x or certain 4DOS versions (feedback req'd!!!)
  - SID: now reads SMS $xx20 song info as song title when the file is
         in RAW format. Also characterizes SIDPlay infofiles as such
         in fileselector
  - new archive formats: LHA and ACE (thanks to tmbinc for this)
  - IT: doesn't confuse Kxx and Lxx effects anymore (oopsie :)
  - XM: made vibrato effect (4xx) somewhat weaker (never believed that
        they were to strong - until i found it out myself with my own
        MC6 entry :)
  - new WöRFEL MODE ][ (finally 320x200 ;)
  - included tool "WÅrfel Animator Professional" by Felix Domke (tmbinc)
    to generate your OWN WÅrfel Mode Animations
  - IT: portamentos "fixed" again (wonder which modules it NOW plays wrong)
  - fileselector: now shows some infos on various internal data files
  - restructured file selector a bit. the results:
    * .M3U AND .PLS PLAY LIST SUPPORT! YEAH! you can now simply select
      any .m3u or .pls play list from the file selector and all files
      it containeth will be loadeth! ;)
      (Beware, if your playlists contain long file names, they will of
       course only be loaded when you're running win95, i didn't include
       a "guess-the-right-filename" routine ;)
    * also reads MikIT .PLT play lists (thanks to Lemm for this)
    * In fileselector, you can now save a WinAmp-compatible .PLS play
      list with Alt-P
    * As a little side effect the actual playing module is now continued
      while eg. un-zipping the next (decreasing the pause between two
      modules a bit, but i may remove this again, as it MAY cause problems
      in win95 background between two modules. well, as always, i need
      feedback ;)
  - LAST "eval" release before the REAL one - Houston, the Eagle is just
    about, uhm, like, landing ;))



OpenCP 2.0p_31337:
  - increased the Quality Mixer's speed AND sound quality - now does
    jeff93.it fine on my P133 and those volume problems finally belong
    to the past
  - MP3: changed win95 bg playing scheme a bit - should now produce less
         (or maybe no?) clicks on some machines when running in foreground
  - MOD: the player now (hopefully) plays exactly like PT1.1B does -
         so DON'T blame me if OpenCP now plays your FT2-made MODs wrong.
         (if anyone could tell me how to recognize MODs saved by FT2,
          just contact me)
  - Therefore, new filetype added: MODf for FastTracker-made MODs
  - MOD: modt and m15t file types work again
  - XM: "set finetune" (E5x) command implemented (was ignored before)
  - CDA: re-enabled (was a typo in one of the sources, sorry ;)
  - new module type: MXM (from pascal's Tiny GUS Player) (EXPERIMENTAL!)
    * this format is size optimized, so don't expect any module or instrument
      names therein, it's just pure music ;)
    * in some converted .XMs, the loops seem incorrect, but i don't know
      if it's the fault of opencp or xm2mxm.exe
  - SID: RAW sidfile support, now supports raw C64 data files which follow
         the inofficial SMS ("Scene Music Standard") way of putting two
         JMPs to the Init and Play routine in front of the file
  - hopefully vastly increased stability when using wave table cards. At
    least with my IW, OpenCP, uhm, almost never crashes anymore :) (feedback
    on this required!!!)

OpenCP 2.0n:
Much time has passed. TOO much time. 1.5 years, to be precise. CP's re-
putation was lost. Noone remembered it anymore. Only one guy decided
to annoy Pascal till he gave up and sent out the source - under the
constraint to release it GPL'ed. So, about 4 months of heavy source
reading, bugfixing, cursing, rebooting et cetera passed again till this
version saw the light of the world.
Too much has changed since v2.0a++ then, so here are only a few things:
  - Bugfixes, bugfixes, bugfixes, bugfixes and of course bugfixes
  - Terratec EWS64L/XL Codec driver (Thanks to TT again for the card)
  - decent IT player (bugfixed/partially rewritten version of the one
    in the 2.0a++ service packs)
  - Included Michael Schwendt's SIDPlay and rewrote filter handling -
    therefore also 8580 filters are now supported

 -new: 48-bit-Adaptive-Oversampling-Interpolation  (backspace)
   and 64-bit-Full-Oversampling-Interpolation  (2*backspace)
   (FOI always intepolates, AOI only when really needed, but nearly no

v1.0       29.5.95
-------------------
 -authors' addresses have changed, see cp.doc
 -Intelligent Memory Multiplier. Enables you to upload up to 8 megs of
   sampledata to your GUS, CP will try to keep the sound quality as high
   as possible. (not just dull doubling... ;)
 -Windows Sound System / GUS MAX CODEC support (-cc20 / -cc21)
   -GUS daughterboard is WSS. (not tested)
   -makes echos, surround and very very big mods possible on a GUS with a
    daughterboard or a GUS MAX, though the normal GUS mode usually sounds much
    better. backspace should improve the quality)
   -detect only works with GUS daughterboard or GUS MAX.
    normal WSS owners will have to set the port and dma manually.
     (how to detect a WSS?)
 -Advanced Note Dots => N
 -FFT for no coprocessor systems added (-cf for copro owners)
 -common spectrum analyser added in Graphic Spectrum Analyser mode.
   (YEHS!, shift tab to change palette)
 -big graphic spectrum analyser added: 1024*768, (SHIFT-G)
   Pentium recommended for fast mode and Hexium recommended for fine mode.
   Resolution could possibly not increase that much on soft-mixer devices.
 -OKT support (thanks to Sheer/Patraa for OKTs)
 -new pics, new anis, anis need less mem now.
 -analysers for no-coprocessor systems added
 -did you notice, that all 16 bit samples were converted down to 8 bits? ;)

   21: GUS MAX CODEC
 -GUS and serial communication improved (worked with my non-fifo at 19.2k)
 -Slow computer owners may use -cqXXXXX to set the desired mixing rate at 32
   channels, rates at a different number of channels will be interpolated,
   but they will not go beyond the -crXXXXX rate.
   (SiPiYou: Ok?)
 -scopes/gsa modes changed to 640x480, since problems occurred with
   some adaptors
 -ms-dos seems to mess around with the fonts when using code pages,
   which made the graphics mode's text writing routine crash.
 -echo editor added. => E
   does not work with the UltraSound driver, of course!
 -new: file zapper in the fileselector => ctrl-k
   wait for the new fileselector for a better one. this one was just
   included due to many urgent requests, and not much work was put in it,
   so please do not complain!
 -DMF files sound much better now!
    (yes, they really sound better with more effects... |^} )
   Not all effects are implemented yet, so keep complaining!
    (I don't think all of them will ever be implemented...
   And finally more (all?) DMFs will be loaded!
    (how should I know, that I cannot rely on the information in the DMF?)
    All RR Chapter 6 DMFs will be played.
 -the single-channel-scope-and-low-relative-pitch-bug removed.
 -use -md to make midi channel 16 a drum channel.
   (thanks go to Martin Moeller for this info)

   (wow, I finally found a solution... ;)
 -loader bugfixes (XM, S3M, DMF, 669)
 -player bugfixes (S3M, DMF)
 -load old mods now stays on. (kick me for 0.96!)
 -loop modules & midi works
 -walking forward in midi files works
 -esc esc 2 escape
 -save/restore setting moved to alt-f2/f3
 -alt-fX mode keys removed
the next point is only true for Novell EMM386.EXE users:
 -IRQs >= 8 do work now...
   If such an IRQ did occur in real mode, DOS4G did not pass it up
   to protected mode... The bugfix needs an additional interrupt. (0x60)
   You can change the interrupt or turn the bugfix off (in case you are the
   lucky owner of a new DOS4GW.EXE) by the switch -caXX (0:off)


v0.96      2.3.95 
------------------
 -ZIP support (use this, if you can!)  (-> SET TEMP=tempdir)
 -ARJ support (not quite sure about it)
 -DMF support (wellwell... not too proud of it :] 
               but who cares in the times of FastTracker II >) )
 -669 support
 -WOW support 
 -ULT support (don't know about the effects...)
 -old MODs without a signature will only be played if you set a certain switch
 -fileselector: path can be entered manually now     (ctrl-return)
 -XM keyoff effect was misplaced i.e. put before the note instead of after...


v0.95      2.2.95
------------------
 -gus support                                   (-cc5)
    DOES NOT WORK WITH IRQs FROM 8 TO 15!!!
    This seems to be a problem with DOS4GW 1.95...
    If anyone knows how to avoid the loss of interrupts with DOS4GW,
    please send me a message!
 -example echo/reverb batches added...          Cathedral
 -132 column modes and 30/60 rows modes         <x> or <alt/ctrl-z> (VESA)
 -32-bit-fast-fourier-interpolation added       <backspace>
 -midi scopes                                   <o>
 -midi drum channel
 -the FIDO-net adress is now right... ;)
 -vesa support. graphic output should now work correctly
 -text mode analyser's font now set correctly. (hope so..)
 -many loader bugfixes.
 -cooperative command line help
 -OS/2 v3 & sb support (probably also gus, but untested!)
 -CAUTION: CP may cause OS/2 to do random writes at the hard disk!
           Does anyone have more info about this?
