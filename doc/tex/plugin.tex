The capabilities of \cp\ can be extended by plugins. The type of
plugin is not limited, so new graphics modes, file types and even
enhanced players may be added by the user. As development for \cp\ is
done using Wacom C++ 11.0 it is recommended to use this compiler for
developing plugins aswell. We have not tested the plugin interface
with other compilers.\footnote{This might change in the future.}

The following section was written by Felix Domke for the 12th issue of
the hugi diskmag.

\section{Device Development}
\subsection{Introduction to FDOs, DLLs and the CP in general}
Of course, no player can play all formats without errors, support all
soundcards or open all archive formats. While you would have to wait
for a new version of ``normal'' players, you can do something against
it for \cp\ by yourself.

From the technical point of view this is possible since CP
1.666. Here, the so-called \.FDOs were introduced, ``flatmode dynamic
link objects''. All in all these are nothing different than DLLs
which everyone knows from Windows, OS/2 or also Unix. FDOs contain
e\.g\. drivers for soundcards. If a new soundcard was to be
supported, not a new Cubic Player would have to be released but only
a new FDO.

With an entry in \texttt{cp.ini}, you can embedd such a driver.

In Cubic Player 2, these FDOs were replaced by DLLs, i\.e in general
only a different format (however, I am not sure whether FDO also
supported imports.)

The format FDO had been invented by pascal, which means that it was
not supported by any linker. A different thing is the case with the
DLLs of CP2.  They are simply normal LE-DLLs. Everybody who has done
a little more with Watcom C and DOS4G or PMode/W should know the
LE-format: It is used there by default.

In general, there is no great difference between LE-DLLs and
LE-EXEs. LE-EXEs, however, usually contain no imports or exports (the
right professional-version of DOS4GW, DOS4G, supports DLLs).

To reach that the player also works with the normal DOS4GW or even
PMode/W, \cp\ contains a DLL-loader which loads these DLLs and links
them to the main program.  The main program merely consists only of
this DLL-loader (later more about this).

Everyone who has Watcom C can create LE-DLLs.  Of course it's also
possible with other linkers and compilers, but you ought to use
Watcom.

\subsection{How to create DLLs}
If you have already created DLLs once or more, you can probably
ignore this chapter.

Otherwise, it isn't so hard either. Everyone of you has probably made
a program with more than one object file.  The various object files
were linked to a single large EXE in the end.

With DLLs, you usually don't have to change \emph{a single line} of code.

You link one or more object files to a DLL. If other DLLs access to
symbols\footnote{in this case, symbols are variables and functions}
in a DLL, these symbols have to be \emph{exported} from the DLL which
contains them and \emph{imported} in the DLL which uses these
symbols.

The linker does that by itself. You just have to tell it where what
symbols can be found.

For this purpose, \emph{import libraries} exist. They are similar to
normal libraries apart from the fact that they don't contain normal
code but just links to the DLL.  You handle these import libraries
like normal libraries (and object files), you just link them to the
rest. When the linker needs some function which is described in the
library it creates an import (i\.e a relocation/fixup entry) the
target is the corresponding DLL and the corresponding symbol name).

You have to export by EXPs, which are files that contain a list with
the to-be-extracted symbols.  On linking you pass them to the linker
which then creates exports.\footnote{An export is just an entry in
the entry-table but with a name.}

EXPs just look like the following to export the function
\texttt{printf} and the variable \texttt{i}.

\begin{verbatim}
'printf_'
'_i'
\end{verbatim}

You create import libraries by
\texttt{WLIB x.LIB +x.DLL}
presumed that \texttt{x.DLL} contains exports.

The main EXE is actually just such a DLL apart from the fact that it
doesn't contain any imports but an entry-point to \texttt{main\_}.

\subsection{the Internals}
All  DLLs of \cp\ are in \texttt{cp.pak}, which is a Quake-compatible
\texttt{.pak} file. You can  unpack it with normal Quake tools.

I roughly describe the most important DLLs which are in this
\texttt{.pak} file:

\begin{dojlist}
\item[\texttt{arc*.dll}] archive-reader (e.g. ARCZIP.DLL for .ZIP-files)
\item[\texttt{cpiface.dll}] the interface (the screens with trackview and so on)
\item[\texttt{devi.dll}] auxilary  routine  for  the  devices  system  that  reads from\\
   \texttt{cp.ini} (*) what devices are to be loaded and loads them
\item[\texttt{devp*.dll}] player-devices, play samples
\item[\texttt{devs*.dll}] sampler-devices,  are  more or less  able  to sample (e.g. for displaying the FFTs of Audio CDs)
\item[\texttt{devw*.dll}] wavetable-devices,  play more samples at the same time, either directly  on the hardware (GUS, SB32...)  or mix them and play them on DEVPs (DEVWMIX, DEVWMIXQ)
\item[\texttt{fstypes.dll}] module-detection,  song-infos  for  various module-formats are evaluated here
\item[\texttt{hardware.dll}] routines  for  bending and using IRQs,  the  timer and DMAs so that not every device driver needs its own functions
\item[\texttt{load*.dll}]  module-loaders, load various formats
\item[\texttt{pfilesel.dll}] the file selector
\item[\texttt{play*.dll}] plays modules on various devices
\item[\texttt{(*)}] Since version 2.0 many things are not directly retrieved from \texttt{cp.ini} but from an exported \texttt{\_dllinfo}. Read more about this later.
\end{dojlist}

A simplified overview about \cp:

\texttt{cp.exe} loads important DLLs, starts DEVI  to  get  the desired 
devices, and starts the file selector. This program part asks the user
which module he wants, seeks the corresponding LOADer, loads the
module, seeks the corresponding PLAYer, and passes the module to it.
The player seeks the corresponding devices and passes the data that
should be played to them.

At the same time the player passes data to the interface, which was
initialized some time before. The interface displays these data and
evaluates inputs from the user.

\subsection{Our first Cubic-DLL}
To create a DLL, you first have to create an environment where you can
do this best. The easiest method is to install the source of \cp\ and
put one's DLL into the makefile. However, since the directory gets
messy soon, I recommend developing one's DLLs elsewhere.  At first you
should get all \texttt{.lib} and \texttt{.h} of \cp\ by compiling the
player once.\footnote{Soon there is said to come an archive with all
\texttt{.lib} and \texttt{.h} for those people
who just want to develop something new.}

Let's start it all over from the beginning step by step.  As an
example, we want to write an ACE-reader which displays the
descriptions before the final decompressing.

First depack the environment, set the paths correctly and copy the
\emph{TEMPLATE} from the \texttt{indev} directory to \texttt{indef\symbol{92}arcace}.

There you have to change the makefile, namely in this way:
\begin{verbatim}
dest = arcACE.dll
 ...
arcace_desc = 'OpenCP .ACE Archive Reader (c) 1998 Felix Domke'
arcace_objs = arcace.obj
arcace_libs = cp.lib pfilesel.lib
arcace_ver = 0.0

arcace.dll: $(dlldeps) arcace.exp $(arcace_objs)
            $(libdir)$(arcace_libs)
            $(makedll)
            copy arcace.dll \opencp\bin
\end{verbatim}
%$ this line is too fool the sucking xemacs syntax highlightning

You have to enter all destinations for \texttt{dest}, i\.e all DLLs
which shall be created in the end.

\texttt{arcace\_desc} is the description which will be printed. 

\texttt{arcace\_objs} are the object-files which shall be linked to the DLL.

Since there is an implicit-rule which says that WPP386 gets executed
for CPPs for which OBJs with the same name are demanded, there also
has to be an \texttt{arcace.cpp} with our code.

\texttt{arcace\_libs} are  the  (import) libraries  from  which  the  imports  
shall be searched.  Standard functions like \texttt{sprintf\_} etc.\ are
exported in \texttt{cp.lib}.  PFILESEL.LIB contains some functions we
will need later.

\texttt{arcace\_ver} is the version which gets displayed in the linkview of 
\cp. You compute it in a rather strange way. How exactly, I myself haven't
understood, but usually you should convert the version from hex to
decimal (e\.g\. 0x024000 for 2.5.0) and then divide by 100. But
someone must have erred.

The \texttt{copy} at the end copies the DLL right into the CP directory.

In general in an archive-read, two functions are passed, one to read
the file names from the archive and ``tell'' them to the file selector
via callback and another to call the unpacker to unpack a file from
the archive.

To be concrete, it looks like the following:

An \texttt{adbregstruct} gets exported which looks like this:
\begin{verbatim}
struct adbregstruct
{
  const char *ext;
  int (*Scan)(const char *path);
  int (*Call)(int act,
              const char *apath,
              const char *file,
              const char *dpath
             );
  adbregstruct *next;
};
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{ext} is the extension, in our case \texttt{.ace}.

\texttt{Scan} is a function which gets called  with the archive as parameter 
and tells it to the file selector by calling \texttt{adbAdd()}.

\texttt{Call} will get executed then to unpack a file from the archive.

We leave out \texttt{next} because it will be set at runtime anyway.

Now let's export such a struct:
\begin{verbatim}
extern "C"
{
adbregstruct adbACEReg = {".ACE", adbACEScan, adbACECall};
char *dllinfo = "arcs _adbACEReg";
};
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{dllinfo} makes an entry in \texttt{cp.ini} superfluous. It provides 
that CP takes notice of our archive-reader.

However, something like \texttt{link=... arcace.dll} has to be in
\texttt{cp.ini}.

Our \texttt{adbACEScan()} looks like the following\footnote{The
function has been \emph{heavily} simplified and can't be run in
\emph{this} form, but all things concerning \cp\ archives are in it.
Only the ACE-specifical things, most of all the thing with the
SOLID-archives, are missing.}:
\begin{verbatim}
static int adbACEScan(const char *path)
/*
  "path" is the filename of the archive.
  If everything works, 1 will be returned, otherwise 0.
*/
{
 [...]
 sbinfile archive;
/*
  "binfile" is the Library which is used in CP for (almost) all
  file accesses. I think it is EXTREMELY practical. It is
  actually quite self-explanatory. "sbinfile" is a normal file
  on disk.
*/
 if(!archive.open(path, sbinfile::openro))
  return(1);
/*
  When we can't open the archive, we can exit at once :)
*/

 unsigned short arcref;

 char arcname[12];
 char ext[_MAX_EXT];
 char name[_MAX_FNAME];
 _splitpath(path, 0, 0, name, ext);
 fsConvFileName12(arcname, name, ext);
 arcentry a;
 memcpy(a.name, arcname, 12);
 a.size=archive.length();
 a.flags=ADB_ARC;
 if (!adbAdd(a))
 {
  archive.close();
  return 0;
 }
/*
  Here, the archive itself gets added to the file listing,
  namely by adbAdd(arcentry &).
  The struct which adbAdd expects looks like:

  struct arcentry
  {
   unsigned short flags;
   unsigned short parent;
   char name[12];
   unsigned long size;
  };

  "flags" is e.g. ADB_ARC for archives.
  "parent" is not so important at the moment.
  "name" is the file name in 8.3-format (fsConvFileName12
         converts it pretty nicely :)
         (e.g. from "x.y" to "X       .Y  ")
  "size" is simply the length which will be displayed.
*/
  arcref=adbFind(arcname);
/*
  Aferwards we keep the "ref" in our mind so that we can enter
  it as "parent" afterwards. parent is the source-archive so
  that the files there will be unpacked from the right archive
  afterwards... (The file selector creates a list of all files
  in the directory and the files in the archives. For the last
  thing, it calls the archive-reader. If the user presses with
  "Enter" on a file afterwards, the file selector has to know
  what ARCer it has to call and most of all from which archive
  the files come. Therefore the parent has to be set.
*/
 [...]

/*
  Now let's deal with the ACE itself. The ACE format is very
  similar to the RAR one, a detailed
  @REF="format description":"coace.txt"

  In any case the function "ReadNextHeader" reads the header on
  the current position and skips additional bytes if they appear
  (i.e with files the packed data). In this way header comes
  after header, at least it appears. (In reality ReadNextHeader
  SEEKs at the beginning, not at the end, but that's not
  important now, don't get confused by that :)
*/

 arcentry a;
 while(ReadNextHeader(archive))
 {
/*
   Here, the header gets read.
*/
  char ext[_MAX_EXT];
  char name[_MAX_FNAME];

  if(aheader->type==1)

   {

    a.flags=0;
    fsConvFileName12(a.name, name, ext);

    if(!adbAdd(a))

     if(fsScanInArc&&[...])
     {
/*

*/
      dcpr_init_file();
      int rd=dcpr_adds_blk(buf_wr, size_wrb);
      unsigned short fileref;
      fileref=mdbGetModuleReference(a.name, a.size);

      if((fileref!=0xFFFF)&&(!mdbInfoRead(fileref)))

        mdbReadMemInfo(ms, (unsigned char*)buf_wr, rd);
/*
  ...and then we e.g. look for the song name etc. by
  "mdbReadMemInfo". Just for explanation, again:

  with various, format-specific routines.
*/
        mdbWriteModuleInfo(fileref, ms);
/*
  These will also be set then.

  Another thing about the "mdbInfoRead" and "mdbGetModuleInfo":
  At first you have to read what is already known about the

       }
      }
     }
    }
   }
   [...]
  }
 }
 [...]
 archive.close();
 return(1);
}
\end{verbatim}

Now let's come to \texttt{adbACECall}. This function is quite easy.
Depending on \texttt{act}, it has to pack, unpack, move etc. the file
\emph{file} from the archive \emph{apath} to \emph{dpath}.  To  make  it  
easier, only  one  \texttt{act=="adbCallGet"} is  supported, i\.e unpacking.

\begin{verbatim}
static int adbACECall(int act,
                      const char *apath,
                      const char *file,
                      const char *dpath)
{
 switch (act)
 {
  case adbCallGet:
  {
   return !adbCallArc(cfGetProfileString("arcACE", "get",
                                         "ace e %a %n %d"),
                      apath, file, dpath);
/*
   "adbCallArc" is a nice function: it replaces something like
   %a, %n and %d with the passed arguments. The first argument
   has to be inserted for %a, the second for %n and the third
   for %d. Beforehand, "cfGetProfileString" gets from CP.INI
   whether the user wants to use another packer (XACE etc.) and
   that in the section "arcACE" and the key "get=".
   If the key hasn't been found, "ace e %a %n %d" will be taken
   by default, which, by the way, should be correct almost every
   time. :)
*/
  }
  case adbCallPut:
   // not implemented
   break;
  case adbCallDelete:
   // not implemented
   break;
  case adbCallMoveTo:
   // not implemented
   break;
  case adbCallMoveFrom:
   // not implemented
   break;
  }
  return 0;
}
\end{verbatim}

Now a simple \texttt{wmake} compiles the whole thing presumed that a
working \texttt{makefile} is available.
