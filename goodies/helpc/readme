okay, i included some crippled zlib just for compiling the help compiler

don't contact/blame/flame jean-loup gailly or mark adler because of problems
with this. this code has not much to do with their original work :)

almost all comments have been removed (except copyright notices and some
general descriptions) to make the source tight (because this is what kb
wanted, i think)

you surely won't be able to see it, but this is based on zlib-1.1.3

original copyright should be in file zlib.txt

have fun
